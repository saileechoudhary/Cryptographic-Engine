# Cryptographic-Engine

A cryptographic engine is implemented in Java that uses three encryption algorithms:
- Blow Fish
- Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) 
- Data Encryption Standard (DES) 

It takes the user input and then pads it with appropriate number of bits depending upon the size of the input. It then encrypts the data using algorithm selected by the user.
